# Resume Generator Project
A Resume generator created using React. Users can enter their desired information and create a single page resume. They can preview the resume at any time. The website is responsive but the resume preview will only be available in print size. 

## Challenges and Obstacles
The largest challenges were state management and dealing with inputs in React. Deciding upon how the state should be saved (ie. within an object or within an array of objects etc) was difficult. Each option presented benefits and drawbacks but I eventually decided to use objects to store each field to keep it simpler.
